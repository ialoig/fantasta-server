### Start docker swarm
# cluster
docker swarm init --advertise-addr <MANAGER-IP>

# single machine
docker swarm init


### View the current state of the swarm
docker info


### View information about nodes
docker node ls


### Retrieve the join command for a worker
docker swarm join-token worker


### Create the service
#  The --name flag names the service helloworld.
#  The --replicas flag specifies the desired state of 1 running instance.
#  The arguments alpine ping docker.com define the service as an Alpine Linux container that executes the command ping docker.com
docker service create --replicas 1 --name helloworld alpine ping docker.com


# See the list of running services
docker service ls

# Display the details about a service (without pretty will be a JSON)
# SERVICE-ID or SERVICE-NAME if specified while starting the service (eg. helloworld)
docker service inspect --pretty <SERVICE-ID> 


# See which nodes are running the service
docker service ps <SERVICE-ID>


# See details about the container for the task (run it on the node where the task is running)
docker ps


# Change the desired state of the service running in the swarm
docker service scale <SERVICE-ID>=<NUMBER-OF-TASKS>


# Remove the service
docker service rm
